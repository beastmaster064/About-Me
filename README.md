#### Academic Profile 

Ohhh... You don't wanna see that. :p 

#### Hobbies 

- <b>Coding</b> : My love for coding started during 7th or 8th standard when we were introduced to *HTML*.From then me and my friends have participated in two editions of Chrysalis and bagged 2nd and 1st place respectively.It may not been a great achievement,but it's just to showcase my love for coding.It even increased more when I started learning C++ in 11th and 12th.It introduced me to the vast world of Algorithms and Data Structures that inspire me to look upon and solve a good amount of problems and tasks from competitive programming sites.I'm a beginner obviously.

- __Cubing__ :  I have been a speed-cuber for a while now and it has always been one of the things that can relieve my stress during a hectic semester. My personnel record is 11 secs on a 3x3 (i.e) [Rubik's Cube](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=rubik%27s+cube&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwis9MX--v3aAhUYSI8KHerPB8QQ_AUICigB&biw=1536&bih=758#imgrc=osza7DzVNF1xqM:) and I average around 17-19 secs.Attending Competitions have always been an integral part of speed cubing has the community is full of fun people.It doesn't feel like a competition at all,it's more like a fun meet between people of similar interest.

- __Social Media__ : Who doesn't love a good meme that even though you can't relate to but still find it funny... Memes are the greatest invention that the internet has ever made.God Bless.
